Create a base class shape with two double type values and member functions
to input the data and compute_area() for calculating area of figure.
Derive two classesâ€™ triangle and rectangle.
Make compute_area() as a virtual function and redefine this function in the
derived class to suit their requirements.
Write a program that accepts dimensions of triangle/rectangle and display
calculated area.
